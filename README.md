# Valentine Proposal Button Game 💖

This is a fun **Valentine's Day web game** where the user is asked,  
**"Will you be my Valentine?"** with **Yes** and **No** buttons.  

But... if the user clicks **"No"**, the button shrinks while the **"Yes"** button grows,  
making it harder to say "No"! Eventually, the **"No" button disappears**. 😆  

## 🚀 Features
- Cute Valentine’s theme with a GIF.
- Clicking **"No"** cycles through different texts like "Pls", "Sure".
- The **"No" button shrinks** while the **"Yes" button grows**.
- If the **"No" button gets too small**, it **disappears**.
- Clicking **"Yes"** redirects to `final.html`.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- Uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Listens for button clicks to change sizes dynamically.
- Uses **offsetWidth & offsetHeight** to adjust button sizes.
- Changes text dynamically using a predefined array.


## 🎮 How to Play?
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click **"No"** and watch it shrink! 😆
3. Click **"Yes"** and get redirected to `final.html`. 🎉
